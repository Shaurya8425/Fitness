            <h2>1. “Paper Menagerie” by Ken Liu</h2>
            <p>Jack’s mother can make paper animals come to life.

                In the beginning, Jack loves them and spends hours with his mom. But as soon as he grows up, he stops talking to her since she is unable to speak in English.
                
                When his mother tries to talk to him through her creations, he kills them and collects them in a box.
                
                After a tragic loss, he finally gets to know her story through a hidden message that he should have read a long time ago.
                
                What Is Great About It: The story is a simple narration that touches on complex issues. It is about leaving your own country with the promise of a better life.
                
                It is also about the conflicts that can occur between families when different cultures and languages collide. In this case, the tension is so high that it destroys the relationship between a mother and her son.
                
                It also has a moving message about never taking your loved ones for granted.</p>
